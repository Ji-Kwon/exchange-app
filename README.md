Hey, I suck at writing readme files but anyways. I doubt you are going to be able to run this code as we were unable to get it hosted.
To run it you need to change a lot of things. I am honestly submitting this just to make myself feel good.
an npm install must be ran on the front end and back end.
the ipv4 address is in a bunch of the front end screens. It need to be changed to your personal ipv4. There is also a database that isn't even being submitted so you definetely 
wont be able to run it lol.
